# Next.js Web3-React Starter Template.
A Next.js starter template with web3-react support out of the box, allowing for you to quickly start building a web3-enabled dapp.

This app comes equipped with both web3-react and ethers. This frontend also has web3-react's NetworkConnector and multichain support. Happy hacking!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
